1.) This project involves me to configure user registration , login and user's projects record.
2.) First I have configured the register.php file which aims at registering a new user at the portal ,alongwith proper server side validations of the user details.
3.) Then the user is redirected to the login page i.e (login.php) which involves that after login only the user is able to watch the projects he has done so far.
4.) After login the user is redirected to projects.php page where he can see the projects and each record includes three action i.e to view , to edit and to delete the projects.
#key point--> The concept of sessions is used therefore only registered users can access the projects and associated pages.
